### Commands
- brew install pre-commit


Indeed, the described approach requires manual setup and understanding of shell scripting, which might be cumbersome for some users. Unfortunately, as of my last update, Git does not provide a built-in command to automatically set up such advanced pre-commit hooks. However, you can simplify the process significantly by using a tool designed for managing pre-commit hooks, such as `pre-commit`.
    
    The `pre-commit` tool allows you to manage Git pre-commit hooks easily and can run a variety of hooks, including linters and formatters for many programming languages and file types.

  Here's how you can set it up for a Go project to run a linter that also fixes issues automatically:

  ### Step 1: Install pre-commit

    First, you need to install `pre-commit` on your system. Instructions for different operating systems can be found on [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).
    
    ### Step 2: Set Up Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
    
    In the root of your Go project, create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. This file will specify which hooks `pre-commit` should run.
    
    ```yaml
  repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint
      rev: v1.45.0 # Use the latest golangci-lint version
      hooks:
        - id: golangci-lint
          args: ['--fix']
    ```
    
    This configuration tells `pre-commit` to use `golangci-lint` and to run it with the `--fix` argument, which automatically fixes any fixable issues.

  ### Step 3: Install the Git Hook Scripts

  Run the following command in your project directory to set up the pre-commit hook based on your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
    
    This command installs the Git pre-commit hook. Now, every time you commit, `pre-commit` will run `golangci-lint` with the `--fix` option.
    
    ### Step 4: Commit Your Changes
    
    When you attempt to commit your changes, the pre-commit hook will run automatically. If `golangci-lint` makes any fixes, you will need to stage those changes and commit again.

  ### Advantages of Using `pre-commit`

  - **Ease of Configuration**: You define your hooks in a simple YAML file.
  - **Extensibility**: You can easily add more hooks for different types of checks or languages.
  - **Community Support**: Many pre-made hooks are available for various tools and languages.
  - **Version Control for Hooks**: You specify the version of the tools you're using, ensuring consistency across development environments.
    
    Using a tool like `pre-commit` can streamline the setup and management of Git hooks in your project, making it easier to maintain code quality without the complexity of manual hook management.
